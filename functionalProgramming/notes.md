# What is functional programming?

Programming style where _pure functions_ are used.

* pure functions:
  * return values
  * input parameters
  * causes no side-effects
  * return value only determined by the function -> self-contained

## why pure functions?

* reusable
* comopsable -> can be combined
* testable
* always the same output, given the same input

## how to keep a state

_analogy_: application state like radioactive material; it is dangerous, but needed.

The app needs _state_, but if uncontrolled, things get dirty.

## functional programming vs. functional programming language

* functional programming in non-functional language like JavaScript -> requires self-discipline
* functional programming languages _forces_ the functional programming style.
